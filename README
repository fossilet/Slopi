This project is to find self-locating numbers in Pi.

Self-locating numbers are numbers that the number n is at postion n (after the decimal point) in decimal digits of Pi. http://oeis.org/A057680

I have found the first 5 such numbers. It is a quick python script, which run 22 minutes on my laptop to find them. I am now looking for the next one from 1 trillion digits of Pi.

Please help me to make this program as fast as possible.

The C program is Linux-dependent.
