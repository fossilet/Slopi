Slopi is short for Self-Locating numbers in PI.

Self-locating numbers are numbers that the number n is at postion n (after the decimal point) in decimal digits of Pi. 

The first 5 such numbers are 1, 16470, 44899, 79873884 and 711939213. It is a quick python script, which runs 22 minutes on my laptop to find them. I am now looking for the next one from 1 trillion digits of Pi.

The C program is developed under Linux, but may also run on various Unix's.

Slopi is not limited to search in pi only, it can be use to search in any numbers.
