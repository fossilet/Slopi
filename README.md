This project's goal is to find self-locating numbers in Pi.

Self-locating numbers are numbers that the number n is at postion n (after the decimal point) in decimal digits of Pi. 

I have found the first 5 such numbers. It is a quick python script, which runs 22 minutes on my laptop to find them. I am now looking for the next one from 1 trillion digits of Pi.

The C program is developed under Linux, but may also run on various Unix's.

TODO

* Pleease fork and help me to make this program faster.
